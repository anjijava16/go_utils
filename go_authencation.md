In your code snippet, you're attempting to create an HTTP client with custom settings and then use it within an OAuth2 client for making HTTP requests. However, you've made a syntax error when instantiating the `http.Client` struct. Here's the corrected version:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"net/http"

	"golang.org/x/oauth2"
)

func main() {
	// Create an HTTP client with custom settings
	rawClient := http.Client{}

	// Create an OAuth2 HTTP client with the custom HTTP client and a static token source
	httpClient := oauth2.NewClient(
		context.WithValue(context.Background(), oauth2.HTTPClient, &rawClient),
		oauth2.StaticTokenSource(&oauth2.Token{AccessToken: "your-access-token"}),
	)

	// Use the OAuth2 HTTP client to make HTTP requests
	resp, err := httpClient.Get("your-url")
	if err != nil {
		// Handle error
	}
	defer resp.Body.Close()

	// Process the response
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Creating the HTTP Client**:
  - `rawClient := http.Client{}` creates a new HTTP client with default settings. You can customize it further if needed.
  - Note: You need to use a pointer to `http.Client` when passing it to `oauth2.NewClient`.

- **Creating the OAuth2 HTTP Client**:
  - `oauth2.NewClient` creates an OAuth2-enabled HTTP client using the provided context, HTTP client, and token source.
  - `context.WithValue` is used to associate the custom HTTP client with the OAuth2 configuration.

- **Using the OAuth2 HTTP Client**:
  - `httpClient.Get("your-url")` performs an HTTP GET request using the OAuth2-enabled HTTP client.
  - Replace `"your-url"` with the actual URL you want to request.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Always handle errors returned by HTTP requests and ensure proper resource cleanup, such as closing the response body.

Ensure you replace `"your-access-token"` with your actual OAuth2 access token and `"your-url"` with the URL you want to request.
