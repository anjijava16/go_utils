It seems you want to apply the `cobra.MaximumNArgs(1)` validation within the `Run` function of a Cobra command and handle the error if the validation fails. Here's how you can achieve that:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"os"

	"github.com/spf13/cobra"
)

func main() {
	rootCmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "mycli",
		Short: "My CLI application",
		Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
			if err := cobra.MaximumNArgs(1)(cmd, args); err != nil {
				fmt.Println("Please enter valid data")
				os.Exit(1)
			}
			// Your command logic here
			fmt.Println("Valid data received:", args)
		},
	}

	if err := rootCmd.Execute(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Validation Inside `Run` Function**:
  - The `Run` function of the command directly includes the argument validation logic.
  - `cobra.MaximumNArgs(1)(cmd, args)` is used to apply the validation for at most 1 argument.
  - If the validation fails (i.e., if there are more than 1 argument), it prints an error message and exits the program.

- **Handling Errors**:
  - The `rootCmd.Execute()` call returns an error if there's any issue during command execution. This error is checked, and if it's not `nil`, it's printed, and the program exits with a non-zero status code.

- **Command Logic**:
  - Below the validation check, you can place your actual command logic that executes when the validation passes. In this example, I've added a simple print statement to indicate that valid data was received.

### Usage:

You can run this CLI application and observe the behavior:

- Valid usage with 1 or fewer arguments:
  ```sh
  ./mycli arg1
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Valid data received: [arg1]
  ```

- Invalid usage with more than 1 argument:
  ```sh
  ./mycli arg1 arg2
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  Please enter valid data
  ```
